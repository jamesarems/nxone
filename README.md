 NOTE : If you dont need shared storage skip to Step 3 .


* Step 1  SetUp GlusterFS for NXONE

  Before setting up gluster , we need to add both hosts name in /etc/hosts file and also run *hostnamectl set-hostname "your FQDN"* .
  
  If we need to mount perticular harddisk to use glusterfs , then format it using linux filesystem and create a directory and mount it.
  
  eg : mkdir /data
  
 > mount /dev/sdc1 /data

  After that we need to create a directory inside the mount point . Glusterfs will not work with mount point itself.
  
  eg : mkdir -p /data/dr0
  
  After this we all set to go with installer. 
  
  > cloud-install gluster
  
  Run this command on both servers.
  
* Step 2  Configuring GlusterFS  

  > cloud-install glusterconf
  
* Step 3 Installing NXONE

  > cloud-install nxsetup

# LizardFS Support

We can install Lizardfs rather than using glusterFS . If you are intrested about LIzardfs then please dont install gluster .

First install Step 3 from above and continue here.

 > cloud-install lizardfs

  > cloud-install lizardfs-shadow

* Step 2b  Configuring Chunk nodes

  NOTE : You have to run this command on every nodes.
